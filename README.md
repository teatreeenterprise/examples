# Enterprise API Documentation

## Overview
Our Enterprise API provides seamless deployment solutions for AI models, ensuring optimal performance and scalability for your organization's needs.

## Enterprise API Architecture
Our infrastructure enables clients to select preferred models from the [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search) repository, which we then deploy on our high-performance GPU/CPU servers. Access is provided through a dedicated endpoint at https://deployment.region.enterprise.teatree.chat, leveraging Ollama's robust server capabilities.

## Ollama Implementation Benefits
We've chosen Ollama for its exceptional versatility across both small and enterprise-scale deployments. For demanding computational requirements, we offer H100G GPU configurations capable of handling resource-intensive models. Our multi-server deployment strategy includes intelligent load balancing that automatically directs requests to the most available resources, maximizing efficiency and minimizing latency.

## Support Channels
For technical assistance or consultation, our team is readily available via our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/m2vs6fyZgE), which provides the most responsive support experience.
